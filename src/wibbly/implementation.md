# Writing your own Wibbly

Wibbly, currently, is extremely slow.
This is why it might not be a bad idea to write your own implementation
or to use someone else's.
This page will explain what metrics Wibbly gathers,
how to parse them,
and how to make sure you have a Wobbly-compliant JSON file by the end of it.


## Existing Implementations

TODO: write my own implementation and link it in here.


## Metrics

TODO: Explain which metrics are gathered and how to parse them.


## Output File

TODO: Explain how to format the output file.
