# Making Use of the Wobbly Output

There are two straightforward ways to make use of the clip you've just fixed up in Wobbly.

## From Wobbly Itself

Within Wobbly's "Project" dropdown menu,
you can save a script.
This will output a "vpy" file
next to the Wobbly JSON file.

![Generated Script](imgs/generated_script.png)

You can simply stick the contents of this script into your own script and work from there.
